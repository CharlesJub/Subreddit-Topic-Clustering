Hear me out. So, I‚Äôve noticed that Petey‚Äôs been thinning on the top ever since he joined the league. I (and a few of my friends) also went bald, albeit my receding a bit slower.

Even though I had a great paying career, money couldn‚Äôt buy back my hair, and I definitely didn‚Äôt have the head shape to rock a shaved head. I personally think that Petey‚Äôs male pattern baldness is maybe causing a bout of depression? The guy is in his mid-20‚Äôs, and losing hair at that age would feel pretty debilitating.
